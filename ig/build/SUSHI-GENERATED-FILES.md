# SUSHI-GENERATED FILES #

The following table shows all IG config files that were generated or copied by SUSHI.  The first column
represents the SUSHI-generated file. Authors should NOT edit SUSHI-generated files, else their edits will
be overwritten the next time SUSHI is run. Where applicable, the last column shows the files that are used
as input into the generated files. Authors should edit the input files in order to affect the SUSHI-generated
files.

NOTE: This file does not currently list the FHIR resources and examples generated from .fsh files. It only
lists those files generated from project configs or the contents in the ig-data folder.
